# A Novel Anti-Sample Generation Technique for Effective Machine Unlearning

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that effectively neutralizes the influence of a specific data subset on an existing trained model. Our algorithm generates noise that acts in opposition to the target data subset while preserving a significant amount of model performance on the remaining datapoints. 

We present two results:  
- **Unlearning-30**: 30% of the data is used in the train-to-unlearn step.  
- **Unlearning-100**: 100% of the data is used in the train-to-unlearn step.  

Empirical results for these are demonstrated on a ResNet18 model using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The experiments can be found in the following notebooks:  
- `test_example_single_class_unlearning_30.ipynb`  
- `test_example_single_class_unlearning_100.ipynb`

## üöÄ Usages

To perform `Single Class Unlearning` task on other models and datasets change values of the following variables:  

`dataset_name = 'cifar10' [#'cifar10', 'svhn', 'mnist' , 'fashionMNIST'#]`  
`model_name = 'MobileNet_v2' [#'ResNet9', 'LeNet32', 'AllCNN', 'ResNet18', 'MobileNet_v2'#]`  
`retain_data_percent = 30 [#100#]`  

Run:
```bash
chmod +x single_class_unlearning.py

```bash
./single_class_unlearning.py
